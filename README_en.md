# Hello Gombok! 👋
Hello! This tool is a tool that provides similar functions to [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/), one of the Java Libraries, in Golang.
Using this tool, you can easily create and use frequently used utility functions such as Getter, Setter, Constructor, Builder, etc. in Golang using comment annotations.

# Install With Go
- [Don't you have Go installed?](https://go.dev/dl/)

Type the following command in the terminal.
```bash
$ go install github.com/YangTaeyoung/gombok@v1.0.0
```

# Usage
1. Go to the folder to scan for annotations.
```bash
cd <path>
```

     ```go
     // in ./test/test.go
     
     // @Builder
     type Test struct {
         Name string
         Age  int
     }
     ```
2. Run the following command.
```bash
$ gombok
```
3. gombok scans all Go files in the `test` folder, finds annotations, and creates the following file.
    ```go
    // in ./test/test_gombok.go
   
   // DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. THIS FILE WAS AUTO GENERATED BY GOMBOK.
    package test
    
    // TestBuilder is a builder for Test
    type TestBuilder struct {
        target *Test
    }
    
    // SetName sets the Name field of the target Test
    func (tb TestBuilder) WithName(name string) TestBuilder {
        tb.target.Name = name
    
        return tb
    }
    
    // SetAge sets the Age field of the target Test
    func (tb TestBuilder) WithAge(age int) TestBuilder {
        tb.target.Age = age
    
        return tb
    }
    
    // Build constructs a Test from the builder
    func (tb TestBuilder) Build() Test {
        return *tb.target
    }
    
    // NewTestBuilder creates a new builder instance for Test
    func NewTestBuilder() TestBuilder {
        return TestBuilder{target: &Test{}}
    }
    ```
4. Now you can use the easily created function as follows.
    ```go
    func SomeMethod() {
        test := NewTestBuilder().WithName("Yang").WithAge(25).Build()
    }
    ```

# Annotations

| `@AllArgsConstructor`| Creates a Constructor that takes all parameters.                                 |
| `@NoArgsConstructor` | Creates a Constructor that takes no parameters.                                  |
| `@RequiredArgsConstructor` | Creates a Constructor that takes only fields with the `validate:"required"` tag. |
| `@Builder` | Creates a Builder.                                                               |

| `@ToString` | Creates a `ToString()` function.                                                   |
| `@Equals` | Creates an `Equals()` function.                                                    |

# Tags
다음 태그를 이용하여 gombok을 통해 생성되는 함수의 동작을 변경할 수 있습니다.

| Tag           | Value | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------| --- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `validate` | `required` | Specifies the fields created by the @RequiredArgsConstructor annotation. |
| `constructor` | `ignore` | The field with this tag is excluded from the Constructor created by the `@AllArgsConstructor` and `@RequiredArgsConstructor` annotations. |
| `builder`     | `ignore` | The `WithXXX()` method is not created in the `Builder` created by the `@Builder` annotation for the field with this tag.                     |
| `getter`      | `ignore` | The Getter method of the corresponding field created by the `@Getter` annotation is not created for the field with this tag.                                |
| `setter`      | `ignore` | The Setter method of the corresponding field created by the `@Setter` annotation is not created for the field with this tag.                                |
| `to_string`   | `ignore` | The `String()` method created by the `@ToString` annotation is excluded from the field with this tag.                                    |


## Trouble Shooting 👊

```bash
$ aws-secret-gen
> zsh: command not found: aims-cli
```
error that occurs when running a program installed with go. 

Add the environment variable as follows at the bottom of the `~/.zshrc` file (or `~/.bashrc`).
```bash
# ...
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```
